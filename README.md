This is a simple project to deploy a Jenkins server on the AWS Cloud in a Declarative way, using Terraform.
This eliminates the burden to set Jenkins Server manually.

[N.B. You can also install Jenkins on Windows: See instruction the end of this page]


We have split the main terraform file into three files:
  - instance.tf: This file is the Main File that declare the resources, the AMI images, the Availability Zones, the ports mapping, the access method, etc.
  - vars.tf: This file contains the variables. It is not necessary to split it this way, but is very useful when we want to quickly change a variable. Modular development is always a good practice
  - web.sh : This file contains the provisioning commands: the installation command for installing anything we want, once the instances have started. This is where we declare the Jenkins installation packages and its dependencies
  
  
<b> Instructions: </b>

<b>I. From AWS Console</b>

- Login to your AWS Account and create an <b>iam user</b> or used and <b>existing iam user</b>, then download the <b>iam credential</b> to configure your local command line interface to communicate with your AWS account.
- Login to your AWS Account and create a <b>pem</b> Key-Pair. mine is "tchamna_aws.pem", but it is a good practice to give a name that reflect the service you are running. For Example, "jenkins_key.pem"

<b>II. From your Local Computer</b>

- Place the pem key in the root directory of your project
- Open a terminal. I recommend <b> git bash</b> if you are on windows (download and install it)
- Change the directory with a cd command from the terminal and point to the directory of your project
- Run the terraforms commands:
- <b> terraform init</b>: The terraform init command initializes your working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.
- <b>terraform plan </b> (This is optional): The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure. 
-  <b>terraform fmt</b> (This is optional, but good practice): To format and present your terraform in a nice and more presentable way
-  <b>terraform validate</b> (This is optional): To check compiling and syntax errors in the .tf files
-  <b>terraform apply</b>: The terraform apply command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan.

<b> Bonus: Install Jenkins on Windows </b>

1. Install Chocolatey from the command line (See instructions here: https://chocolatey.org/install)
2. Open command line as <b> Administrator </b> and paste the following command <b> choco install jenkins </b>
3. open your browser and paste the following URL: <b> http://localhost:8080/ </b>
